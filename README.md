# Android-APK-Protect-Project
This is the project that protects the APK from illegal modifying.

This project used the Android NDK(C++) as its major functional language.

In this project, main factor to protect the APK is a checksum and AES256.
And whole byte code has been encrypted to make it more complicated for hackers to understand what it works like.
