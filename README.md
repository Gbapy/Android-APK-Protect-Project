# Android-APK-Protect-Project
This is the project that protects the APK from illegal modifying.

This project has been developed with NDA to protect Android APKs from illegal modification by hackers.
This project used the Android NDK(C++) as its major functional language.

At this project, main factor to protect the APK is a checksum and AES256.
And whole byte code has been encrypted to make it more complicated for hackers to understand what it works like.

If initerested in this kind of project, please contact me at: Gbapyou@gmail.com (Skype: live:bigblackbead)
